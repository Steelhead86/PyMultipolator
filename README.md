# PyMultipolator
PyMultipolator (PM) is a small Python package originally based on Carlos Munoz' C-language program, Multipolator (https://github.com/munozcar/multipolator).

PM performs interpolations in multiple dimensions, through co-adding and an inverse linear weighting scheme. It is designed to be used on many-dimensional data sets; for example, producing approximations of spectra of astronomical objects by multiple interpolation ("multipolation") of data points close to the requested data point.

Here you will find both the main PyMultipolator mini-package and an example use case.
