# PyMultipolator
PyMultipolator (PM) is a small Python package originally based on Carlos Munoz' C-language program, Multipolator (https://github.com/munozcar/multipolator).

PM performs interpolations in multiple dimensions, through co-adding and an inverse linear weighting scheme. It is designed to be used on many-dimensional data sets; for example, producing approximations of spectra of astronomical objects by multiple interpolation ("multipolation") of spectra with parameters close to the requested parameters.

Here you will find both the main PyMultipolator mini-package and an example use case.
